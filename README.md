# tiny-robot
Repository to track the progress of the tiny robot project

The robot is a two servomotor robot which should be able at last to move rotating on itself, and by nodding with his head. The body will be 3D printed and the animations are created by chatGPT. for now the system is running on a arduino NANO with the old bootloader and receives commands thank to a IR receiver of a rgb libht bulb
